3. **Risk Assessment Color**: Fixed risk assessment colors not displaying correctly
4. **Operating System Detection**: Fixed OS and browser information not displaying in reports
5. **Port Scan Results**: Fixed network security results not showing in reports
6. **Scanner Names**: Fixed scanner names having "client 6" prefix added to them
7. **Worker Timeout**: Fixed timeout issues during scanning

## How to Apply the Fixes

All fixes have been applied automatically. To make them effective:

1. **Fixed app.py**: The application startup error has been fixed
2. **Fixed client.py**: The report_view function has been fixed to properly use process_scan_data
3. **Database Updates**: Scan records have been updated with proper structure
4. **Template Fixes**: The results.html template has been fixed to display colors properly

Restart the application server to apply all fixes:

```
gunicorn -w 4 --timeout 120 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

## Verification Steps

After restarting the server, verify the fixes by:

1. Checking that the application starts without errors
2. Viewing an existing scan report to confirm it displays:
   - Risk assessment color correctly
   - OS and browser information
   - Port scan results
3. Creating a new scan to ensure all data is captured and displayed properly
4. Creating a new scanner to verify no "client 6" prefix is added

## Technical Summary

The comprehensive fixes address multiple layers of the application:

1. **Code-level fixes**: Fixed syntax errors and logic issues in app.py and client.py
2. **Data structure fixes**: Ensured scan data is properly formatted in all databases
3. **Display fixes**: Updated templates to properly use the available data
4. **Core functionality improvements**: Enhanced scanner capabilities for better data capture

These fixes ensure that the CybrScan platform now properly displays all scan information, uses correct color coding for risk assessments, and handles scanner names properly.
