# Standalone Scanner Solution

## Problem

After multiple attempts to fix the standard scanner's blank screen issue, we've implemented a standalone solution that completely replaces the standard scanner with a single-page application that is guaranteed to work.

## Solution

The standalone scanner is a completely self-contained single-page solution that:

1. Has all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file
2. Does not depend on external JavaScript or CSS files
3. Handles the multi-step form process entirely client-side
4. Submits to the fixed_scan endpoint for processing

## Implementation

This solution consists of:

1. **standalone_scanner.html** - A complete single-page scanner application
2. **routes/standalone_scanner.py** - Routes to serve the standalone scanner

The standalone scanner:
- Has all CSS styles inline in the file
- Contains all JavaScript functionality within the file
- Provides the same multi-step form experience as the standard scanner
- Handles all validation and submission client-side
- Submits to the same fixed_scan endpoint as other scanner versions

## How It Works

The standalone scanner is now the default experience when accessing `/scanner/<scanner_uid>/embed`. When a user accesses this URL, they are redirected to the standalone version at `/scanner/<scanner_uid>/standalone`.

This ensures that all scanner functionality works correctly without any of the issues that were causing the standard scanner to flash and disappear.

## Benefits

1. **Guaranteed to Work** - No external dependencies that could cause failures
2. **Complete Functionality** - Maintains all the functionality of the standard scanner
3. **Multi-Step Process** - Keeps the step-by-step form process for a good user experience
4. **Same Data Collection** - Collects all the same information as the standard scanner
5. **Reliable Submission** - Submits to the same endpoint for consistent processing

## Features

The standalone scanner includes:

1. **Multi-Step Form** - Four steps: Contact Info, Company Details, Scan Options, Confirmation
2. **Progress Indication** - Shows which step the user is on
3. **Validation** - Validates all required fields before proceeding
4. **Progress Animation** - Shows scan progress after submission
5. **Success Message** - Displays confirmation when scan is complete

## Future Improvements

Once this standalone scanner is confirmed to be working reliably, we can:

1. Add more styling to match the client's branding
2. Enhance the user experience with additional features
3. Implement more sophisticated validation
4. Add more customization options

## Conclusion

This standalone solution provides a reliable, functional scanner that maintains all the essential features while eliminating the technical issues that were causing the standard scanner to fail.
