## Implementation Details

Three new files have been created:

1. `enhanced_admin_dashboard.py`: Core module with data gathering functions
2. `apply_enhanced_dashboard.py`: Script to apply the enhancements
3. `test_enhanced_dashboard.py`: Test script to validate functionality

The implementation uses a non-disruptive approach that enhances the existing dashboard without breaking compatibility. It includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure a stable user experience.

## How to Apply

Run the following command to apply the enhanced admin dashboard:

```bash
python apply_enhanced_dashboard.py
```

Once applied, the admin dashboard will automatically show comprehensive data about clients, scanners, and leads.

## Testing

To verify the enhanced dashboard functionality before applying:

```bash
python test_enhanced_dashboard.py
```

This will test all data gathering functions and provide a summary of available data.

## Technical Summary

- **Runtime Patching**: Enhances the admin dashboard route without modifying existing code
- **Cross-Database Aggregation**: Collects data from main and client-specific databases
- **Error Resilience**: Handles missing tables and provides fallbacks for all operations
- **Non-Blocking Design**: All operations have timeouts and exception handling
- **Future-Ready**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new dashboard sections
