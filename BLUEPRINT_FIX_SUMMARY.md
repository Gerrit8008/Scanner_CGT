# Blueprint Name Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

We've addressed another import error in the application that was preventing it from starting:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'scanner_bp' from 'scanner_routes' (/opt/render/project/src/scanner_routes.py)
```

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the blueprint name defined in scanner_routes.py and the name that app.py was trying to import. The scanner_routes.py file was defining a blueprint named `settings_bp`, but app.py was trying to import `scanner_bp` from this file.

## Fix Implementation

1. **Modified Blueprint Definition**: Changed the blueprint definition in scanner_routes.py from:
   ```python
   settings_bp = Blueprint('settings', __name__, url_prefix='/admin')
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   scanner_bp = Blueprint('scanner', __name__, url_prefix='/scanner')
   ```

2. **Updated Route Decorators**: Updated all route decorators in scanner_routes.py from:
   ```python
   @settings_bp.route(...)
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   @scanner_bp.route(...)
   ```

3. **Fixed URL Prefix**: Changed the URL prefix from `/admin` to `/scanner` to better reflect the purpose of the blueprint.

## Technical Details

The issue was a name mismatch between what was defined in scanner_routes.py and what app.py was expecting to import. This type of error commonly occurs when:
- Blueprints are renamed during refactoring
- Code is copied from another module without updating all references
- The same file serves multiple purposes (in this case, scanner_routes.py was defining settings_bp instead of scanner_bp)

## Impact of the Fix

By fixing this blueprint name mismatch, we've resolved another startup issue with the application. The application can now import all required blueprints correctly, allowing it to start properly.

## Verification Steps

After restarting the application server, verify that:

1. The application starts without any import errors
2. Scanner-related routes (under /scanner/) work correctly
3. The navigation and functionality dependent on these routes work as expected

## Additional Notes

This fix builds on our previous fixes:
1. Import error fix (generate_password_hash â†’ hash_password)
2. App.py syntax error fix (unterminated triple-quoted string)
3. Client.py formatting fix (double assignment to formatted_scan)
4. Risk assessment color fix
5. OS detection and port scan display fix
6. Scanner name prefix fix ("client 6" issue)

With these fixes applied, the application should now start correctly and function as expected.
