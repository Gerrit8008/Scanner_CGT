# CybrScan Modular Structure

The large 4382-line `app.py` file has been refactored into 3 smaller, more manageable modules:

## File Structure

### 1. `app_config.py` (Configuration & Utilities)
- **Purpose**: All configuration, imports, constants, and utility functions
- **Contains**:
  - Import handling with fallbacks
  - Configuration constants (SEVERITY, GATEWAY_PORT_WARNINGS, etc.)
  - Utility functions (validate_email, sanitize_input, etc.)
  - Logging setup
  - System information functions
  - Industry determination logic

### 2. `app_routes.py` (Route Handlers)
- **Purpose**: All Flask route handlers and web functions
- **Contains**:
  - Basic routes (/, /health, /pricing)
  - API endpoints (/auth/api/*)
  - Admin routes (/customize, /db_fix)
  - Scan routes (/scan, /results)
  - Error handlers
  - Route setup function that takes app as parameter

### 3. `app.py` (Main Application)
- **Purpose**: Flask app creation, blueprint registration, and startup
- **Contains**:
  - App factory function (create_app)
  - Blueprint registration logic
  - Database initialization
  - CORS and rate limiting setup
  - Main entry point

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility
2. **Readability**: Much smaller files (400-500 lines each vs 4382 lines)
3. **Modularity**: Functions can be imported and tested independently
4. **Debugging**: Easier to locate issues in specific modules
5. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

## Backwards Compatibility

- All original functionality is preserved
- Import statements work the same way
- Environment variables and configuration unchanged
- Database paths and structures unchanged

## Original Backup

The original `app.py` is saved as `app_original_backup.py` for reference and rollback if needed.

## Usage

The application starts the same way:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

All routes, blueprints, and functionality remain identical to the original monolithic structure.
