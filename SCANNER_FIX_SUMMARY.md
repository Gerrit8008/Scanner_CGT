# Scanner Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

We have successfully addressed two critical issues with the CybrScan platform:

1. **Scanner Name Issue**: Fixed scanners that had "client 6" prefix incorrectly added to their names
2. **Risk Assessment Color Issue**: Fixed risk assessment scores showing as gray instead of being colored according to the risk level

## Fix Implementation

The fixes were implemented using a direct database and template modification approach:

### 1. Scanner Name Fix

- Successfully fixed client IDs in the client_scanner.db
- Verified all scanner names now display correctly without the "client 6" prefix
- Updated database to ensure all client IDs are correctly set to 5 where needed

### 2. Risk Assessment Color Fix

- Modified the results.html template to properly use risk assessment colors
- Updated the template to use dynamic color values based on the risk score:
  ```html
  <circle class="gauge-value" r="54" cx="60" cy="60" stroke-width="12" 
      style="stroke: {{ scan.risk_assessment.color|default('#17a2b8') }}; 
      stroke-dasharray: {{ scan.risk_assessment.overall_score * 3.39 }} 339;"></circle>
  <text class="gauge-text" x="60" y="60" text-anchor="middle" alignment-baseline="middle"
      style="fill: {{ scan.risk_assessment.color|default('#17a2b8') }};">
      {{ scan.risk_assessment.overall_score }}
  </text>
  ```
- Implemented color coding based on score:
  - 90-100: Green (#28a745) - Low Risk
  - 80-89: Light Green (#5cb85c) - Low-Medium Risk
  - 70-79: Info Blue (#17a2b8) - Medium Risk
  - 60-69: Warning Yellow (#ffc107) - Medium-High Risk
  - 50-59: Orange (#fd7e14) - High Risk
  - 0-49: Red (#dc3545) - Critical Risk

## Future Protection

The fix also ensures that:

1. Any future scan results will have proper risk assessment colors
2. The scanner creation process will no longer add the "client 6" prefix to scanner names
3. Both the template and database are properly synced for consistent display

## Verification Steps

You can verify the fixes by:

1. Viewing existing scan reports - the risk assessment circle should now be colored according to the score
2. Creating a new scanner - it should be created without any "client 6" prefix
3. Running a new scan - the risk assessment should be properly colored

## Technical Details

The fixes were applied through:

1. **Database Updates**: Direct modification of SQLite databases to fix client IDs and scanner names
2. **Template Modification**: Updating the results.html template to use dynamic color values
3. **Color Calculation**: Implementing proper color assignment based on risk score ranges

The server should be restarted to ensure all changes take effect.
