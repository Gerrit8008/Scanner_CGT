# Deployment Status - Auth Routes Fix

## Issue Identified
- `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` returning 404 errors
- Modular structure blueprint registration conflict

## Fixes Applied
1. **Emergency Auth Routes**: Added fallback routes directly to main app
2. **Blueprint Registration**: Fixed existing auth blueprint import and registration
3. **Template Routing**: Added emergency auth route handlers
4. **Debug Endpoints**: Added `/debug/routes` and `/debug/emergency-routes` for troubleshooting

## Deployment Trigger
- Updated app.py with timestamp to force Render redeploy
- Added emergency auth fix module
- Enhanced error handling for auth routes

## Testing Endpoints
After deployment, test:
- `/health` - Should show "version": "modular-v2.0"
- `/debug/routes` - Shows all available routes
- `/debug/emergency-routes` - Confirms emergency fix is active
- `/auth/register` - Should load registration page
- `/auth/login` - Should load login page

## Next Steps
1. Verify deployment with `/health` endpoint
2. Test auth routes are working
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Access admin dashboard at `/admin` once auth is working
