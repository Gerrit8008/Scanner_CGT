   - Network scan results properly use a list of dictionaries for open ports
   - Gateway information properly formatted for template display

2. **Enhanced Detection**
   - OS and browser detection now uses User-Agent headers
   - Port scanning handles different output formats properly
   - All scan types properly generate findings for display

3. **Service Categories**
   - All findings are now properly categorized by service type
   - Network security findings appear under Network Defense
   - Web security findings appear under Web Security
   - System findings appear under Endpoint Security
   - Email findings appear under Data Protection

4. **Results Template Compatibility**
   - All scan results are formatted to work with the existing results.html template
   - No template modifications were required, only proper data formatting

## Usage Instructions

1. Access the fixed scanner at `/fixed-scan`
2. Enter target information (domain, email, etc.)
3. Select scan options
4. Start the scan
5. View real-time progress
6. Access comprehensive results in the standard results page

## Testing and Verification

A test script is included (`run_fixed_scan_test.py`) to verify scanner functionality.

To test the fixed scanner:

```bash
python run_fixed_scan_test.py example.com
```

This will run a test scan against example.com and display a summary of the results, confirming that all scan types are working properly.

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes provide a comprehensive solution to the scanning issues. The fixed scanner now properly detects and displays all scan types, with a modern UI and real-time progress tracking. All scan results are properly formatted for display in the existing results template.
