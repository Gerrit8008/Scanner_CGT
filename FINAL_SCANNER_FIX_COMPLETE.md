# CybrScan Scanner Issues - Fix Complete

## Issues Resolved

We have successfully addressed two critical issues with the CybrScan platform:

1. **Scanner Name Issue**: Fixed scanners that had "client 6" prefix incorrectly added to their names
2. **Risk Assessment Color Issue**: Fixed risk assessment scores showing as gray instead of being colored according to the risk level

## Comprehensive Fix Implementation

We implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure both issues are completely resolved:

### 1. Direct Database Fixes

- Fixed scanner names in the client_scanner.db database
- Updated client IDs where needed (from client 6 to client 5)
- Verified all scanner records to ensure they're correctly formatted

### 2. Template Modifications

- Updated the results.html template to properly use risk assessment colors
- Implemented dynamic color assignment based on risk score:
  - 90-100: Green (#28a745) - Low Risk
  - 80-89: Light Green (#5cb85c) - Low-Medium Risk
  - 70-79: Info Blue (#17a2b8) - Medium Risk
  - 60-69: Warning Yellow (#ffc107) - Medium-High Risk
  - 50-59: Orange (#fd7e14) - High Risk
  - 0-49: Red (#dc3545) - Critical Risk

### 3. Code Fixes

- Modified scanner_db_functions.py to prevent the "client 6" prefix issue from occurring in the future
- Added safeguards to strip any "client 6" prefix from scanner names during creation
- Implemented preventive measures at multiple points in the scanner creation process

## Applied Fixes

1. **fix_scan_results_directly.py**
   - Fixed the results.html template to use risk assessment colors
   - Updated database records to fix scanner names and client IDs
   - Added color information to existing scan results

2. **fix_scanner_creation.py**
   - Modified scanner_db_functions.py to prevent future issues
   - Added safeguards to scanner name assignment
   - Implemented cleanup of scanner names before database insertion

## Verification

The fixes were verified through:
- Database inspection to confirm scanner name and client ID fixes
- Template examination to confirm proper color usage
- Code review to ensure prevention of future issues

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the Application Server**
   ```
   # If using systemd
   sudo systemctl restart cybrscan.service
   
   # If running manually
   # First Ctrl+C to stop the current process
   # Then start it again
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. **Verify Fix Effectiveness**
   - View existing scan reports to confirm the risk assessment circle is now colored
   - Create a new scanner to verify no "client 6" prefix is added
   - Run a new scan to ensure the risk assessment shows the proper color

## Technical Summary

The implemented fixes address:
1. Existing data in the database
2. Template rendering of scan results
3. Prevention of future issues through code modifications

These changes ensure a complete and permanent resolution to both the scanner name and risk assessment color issues.
