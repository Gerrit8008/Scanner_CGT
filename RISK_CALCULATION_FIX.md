# Risk Calculation Fix

## Issue Fixed

We've fixed the risk calculation error in the scan process that was causing the following error:

```
Error calculating risk score: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'int'
```

This error was happening because the risk calculation function was trying to compare a dictionary with an integer value, which is not supported in Python.

## Implementation Details

The fix addresses multiple aspects of the risk calculation and network data handling:

### 1. Robust Risk Assessment Calculation

- Added proper type checking throughout the risk assessment function
- Implemented graceful error handling with fallback values
- Fixed the scoring algorithm to correctly handle all input types
- Ensured color assignment based on score works correctly

### 2. Network Data Handling

- Fixed network scan result processing to ensure it's always in the correct format
- Added type checking for network scan results
- Implemented proper handling of the network data structure
- Added fallback for unexpected data formats

### 3. Findings Extraction

- Improved network findings extraction to properly handle different data formats
- Added robust error handling for malformed data
- Implemented proper type checking before processing network findings
- Ensured consistent extraction of findings from network scan results

## Changes Made

The fix modifies the following components in `fixed_scan_core.py`:

1. **Risk Assessment Function**:
   - Complete rewrite of the `_calculate_risk_assessment` method
   - Added comprehensive try/except handling
   - Implemented proper type checking for all input data
   - Fixed the scoring algorithm to handle different data structures

2. **Network Processing**:
   - Added proper handling of network scan results
   - Ensured network data is always in the expected format
   - Added conversion from different possible network result formats

3. **Findings Extraction**:
   - Improved extraction of findings from network data
   - Added robust handling of tuple-formatted network findings
   - Implemented proper severity filtering for network findings

## How to Verify the Fix

After restarting the application server:

1. Create a new scan targeting a valid domain
2. Check the scan results to ensure the risk assessment color is displayed correctly
3. Verify that the scan completes without the "Error calculating risk score" message
4. Confirm that network findings are properly extracted and displayed

## Technical Details

The fix addresses the specific error by ensuring that all data is properly checked for its type before operations are performed. The key improvements include:

1. Checking if data is a dictionary before accessing its attributes
2. Ensuring all numeric comparisons are performed between compatible types
3. Adding robust error handling to prevent cascading failures
4. Implementing fallback values when data is missing or in an unexpected format

These changes ensure that the risk calculation works correctly regardless of the input data format, providing a robust and reliable scanning experience.
