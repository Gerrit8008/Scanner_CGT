# Scan Display Implementation Guide

This guide provides instructions for implementing the fix for displaying port scan results and OS information in scan reports.

## Overview

The fix addresses two key issues:
1. Missing port scan results (open ports and services) in scan reports
2. Missing OS and browser information in the client information section

## Files Included

1. `fix_scan_data_processor.py` - The main fix script that enhances the scan data processing functions
2. `test_scan_data_processing.py` - A test script to verify the fix is working correctly
3. `deploy_scan_data_fix.sh` - A deployment script that applies the fix and runs tests
4. `SCAN_DATA_DISPLAY_FIX.md` - Documentation explaining the technical details of the fix

## Implementation Steps

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the CybrScann-main directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ggrun/CybrScann-main
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_scan_data_fix.sh
   ```

3. Restart the application server:
   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Implementation

1. Apply the fix to the scan data processing:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ggrun/CybrScann-main
   python3 fix_scan_data_processor.py
   ```

2. Test the changes:
   ```bash
   python3 test_scan_data_processing.py
   ```

3. Create backups of the original files:
   ```bash
   cp client_db.py client_db.py.pre_scan_data_fix
   cp client.py client.py.pre_scan_data_fix
   ```

4. Restart the application server:
   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```

## Verification

After implementation, verify that the fix is working by:

1. Generating a new scan report
2. Checking that the report includes:
   - Port scan results in the "Network Security" section
   - OS and browser information in the "Client Information" section
   - Properly formatted risk assessment indicators

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after implementing the fix:

1. Check the application logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -n 100 scanner_platform.log
   ```

2. Restore the original files from the backups:
   ```bash
   cp client_db.py.pre_scan_data_fix client_db.py
   cp client.py.pre_scan_data_fix client.py
   ```

3. Restart the application server:
   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```
