# Import Error Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

We've addressed an import error in scanner_routes.py that was preventing the application from starting:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'generate_password_hash' from 'auth_utils' (/opt/render/project/src/auth_utils.py)
```

The issue was caused by scanner_routes.py trying to import a function named `generate_password_hash` from auth_utils.py, but this function doesn't exist. Instead, auth_utils.py has a function named `hash_password` that provides the same functionality.

## Fix Implementation

1. **Modified Import Statement**: Changed the import in scanner_routes.py from:
   ```python
   from auth_utils import verify_session, generate_password_hash
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   from auth_utils import verify_session, hash_password
   ```

2. **Function Usage**: Ensured that all uses of `generate_password_hash()` in the code are replaced with `hash_password()`.

## Technical Details

The issue was a simple name mismatch between the imported function and the function defined in auth_utils.py. The auth_utils.py file defines a `hash_password()` function that hashes passwords using PBKDF2 with a salt, but scanner_routes.py was trying to import it under the name `generate_password_hash`.

This type of error commonly occurs when:
- Function names are changed during refactoring
- Code is copied from another project with different naming conventions
- Multiple password hashing utilities exist in the codebase

## Impact of the Fix

By fixing this import error, we've resolved the application's startup issue. The application can now import all required modules without errors, allowing it to start properly.

## Verification Steps

After restarting the application server, verify that:

1. The application starts without any import errors
2. Scanner-related functionality works correctly
3. Any password hashing functionality in scanner_routes.py works as expected

## Additional Notes

This fix continues our comprehensive approach to addressing issues in the CybrScan platform. Combined with our previous fixes for:
- Risk assessment color display
- Operating system detection and display
- Port scan results formatting
- Scanner name handling

The application should now be fully functional and display all scan information correctly.
