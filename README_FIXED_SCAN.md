# CybrScan Fixed Security Scanner

This document explains the enhanced security scanner implementation for CybrScan.

## Overview

The fixed scanner implementation addresses several issues with the original scanner:

1. **OS and Browser Detection**: Properly detects and displays operating system and browser information
2. **Network Security**: Enhanced port scanning with proper results display
3. **Web Security**: Comprehensive web security scanning including security headers, SSL certificate, and sensitive content
4. **Email Security**: Complete email security analysis with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks
5. **Gateway Information**: Improved gateway detection and analysis
6. **Service Category Analysis**: Proper categorization of findings by security service

## Files and Components

### 1. Core Scanning Engine

- **fixed_scan_core.py**: Contains all scanning logic with proper detection for all scan types
  - `FixedSecurityScanner` class handles all scan operations
  - Includes comprehensive detection for OS, browser, network, web, email, and system security

### 2. Web Routes

- **fixed_scan_routes.py**: Implements Flask routes for the fixed scanner
  - `/fixed-scan`: Main page for running scans
  - `/fixed-scan-progress/<scan_id>`: Real-time progress updates
  - `/scan-report/<scan_id>`: Displays scan results using the existing results template

### 3. Templates

- **templates/fixed_scan.html**: Modern UI for the scan page with real-time progress

### 4. Integration

- **integrate_fixed_scan.py**: Helper script to integrate the fixed scanner into the main application
- Added the fixed scan blueprint to **app.py**

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Access the fixed scanner at `/fixed-scan`
2. Enter target information (domain, email, etc.)
3. Select scan options
4. Start the scan
5. View real-time progress
6. Access comprehensive results in the standard results page

### API Usage

The fixed scanner can also be used programmatically:

```python
from fixed_scan_core import run_fixed_scan

# Client information
client_info = {
    'name': 'Test User',
    'email': 'test@example.com',
    'company': 'Test Company',
    'user_agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/91.0.4472.124'
}

# Run a scan
results = run_fixed_scan(
    target_domain="example.com",
    client_info=client_info,
    scan_options={
        'network_scan': True,
        'web_scan': True,
        'email_scan': True,
        'ssl_scan': True
    }
)
```

### Testing

A test script is included to verify scanner functionality:

```bash
python run_fixed_scan_test.py example.com
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Complete OS and Browser Detection**
   - Uses User-Agent string to detect OS and browser
   - Properly displays information in the results page

2. **Enhanced Port Scanning**
   - Comprehensive port scanning with proper results format
   - Detailed information on open ports and services
   - Proper risk assessment based on open ports

3. **Web Security Analysis**
   - Complete security headers analysis
   - SSL certificate validation with expiration checking
   - Sensitive content detection

4. **Email Security**
   - SPF, DKIM, and DMARC record checks
   - Email security scores and recommendations

5. **Results Display**
   - Proper structure for all scan results to work with the existing template
   - Service category analysis for MSP offerings
   - Comprehensive risk assessment

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scan Storage**: Add persistence for scan results in the database
2. **PDF Reports**: Generate downloadable PDF reports
3. **Scheduled Scans**: Allow scheduling regular scans
4. **Custom Scan Profiles**: Allow creating and saving custom scan profiles
5. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation for integration

## Troubleshooting

If the scan results do not display properly:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that the fixed scan blueprint is registered in app.py
3. Ensure that the results template can handle the scan result format
4. Check for any missing dependencies in requirements.txt

For any issues with the scanning engine:

1. Run the test script with a simple domain
2. Check the logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify that all required Python packages are installed
