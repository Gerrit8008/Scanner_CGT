# Subscription Pricing Update

## Overview

The subscription pricing has been updated to match the requirements:

| Level        | Price         | Scanners | Scans/Month | Features                  |
|--------------|---------------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Basic        | Free          | 1        | 10          | Basic branding            |
| Starter      | $59/month     | 1        | 50          | White-label branding      |
| Professional | $99/month     | 3        | 500         | API access, integrations  |
| Enterprise   | $149/month    | 10       | 1000        | 24/7 support, custom dev  |

All functionality has been preserved, and the pricing is now consistent across all parts of the application.
